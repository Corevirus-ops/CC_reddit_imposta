## Project Description 
This project is intended to recreate a reddit like clone as a project for Code Academy to display knowledge in attained skills for Front End display. The idea is to use apis from reddit to be able to display data obtained for a minimalistic approach that still has core functionality of reddit such as viewing post, searching, voting, and /or subscribe to the post.

### Conclusion 
I intend to create a few apps for personal use, such as an RSVP website to gather and obtain data to properly plan and schedule a wedding digitally. I also plan on creating a winco budgeting app so people can put together prices for a shopping list, so that they can cross out what has been grabbed, and to be able to see the predicted end price of those items based on current market.
